      <content type="html" xml:base="/master-of-the-keyboard">&lt;p&gt;The keyboard is the developers palette. A keyboard, to a programmer, should be like an ax to a lumberjack. The keyboard is THE tool of the trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Atwood and Yegge are dead on in &lt;a href=&quot;https://href.li/?http://blog.codinghorror.com/we-are-typists-first-programmers-second/&quot;&gt;We Are Typists First, Programmers Second&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I can’t understand why professional programmers out there allow themselves to have a career without teaching themselves to type. It doesn’t make any sense. It’s like being, I dunno, an actor without knowing how to put your clothes on. It’s showing up to the game unprepared. It’s coming to a meeting without your slides. Going to class without your homework. Swimming in the Olympics wearing a pair of Eddie Bauer Adventurer Shorts.” - Steve Yegge&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pondering on that post and that quote give me resolve to get better. A lot better. To be a master of the keyboard. I don’t merely mean typing speed either. I’m talking ‘efficiency of expression’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal is to achieve the shortest possible distance between your thoughts and their instantiation. The aim is to create and construct at the speed of thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two most impressive and inspiring things I’v seen on typing efficiency have been talks on Vim and Stenographic programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that these are not competing approaches. The stenotype (corded type) method builds directly on top on Vim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What good is your proficiency on the keyboard if you’re constantly going to the mouse to adjust windows? I noticed this a few years ago and was ushered into the world of window managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a window manager is a game-changer. It was for me. My personal favorite is &lt;a href=&quot;https://href.li/?http://manytricks.com/moom/&quot;&gt;Moom&lt;/a&gt; (Mac only). I can now fully manipulate my environment without wasting time constantly fiddling with window sizes. This is why I’m a big fan of &lt;a href=&quot;https://href.li/?http://www.alfredapp.com/&quot;&gt;Alfred&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
