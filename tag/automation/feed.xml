      <content type="html" xml:base="/previous-attempts-to-regulate-automation">&lt;p&gt;In 1987 the world had its first electronic stock exchange, the NASDAQ terminal. Traders could now type orders directly into a computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A trader named Thomas Peterffy didn’t want to type in the orders so he and his engineers hacked into the NASDAQ terminal such that it could be wired directly to their own computer, which traded automatically based on algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A senior NASDAQ official saw Peterffy’s setup and said Peterffy was breaking the rules: All orders had to be entered through the keyboard. He gave Petterfy’s group one week to fix the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peterffy and his engineers came up with a solution. They built a mechanical robot with rubber fingers that typed entries into the keyboard. It’s reported that the inspector stormed out of the room upon seeing the hulking machine but it technically satisfied the NASDAQ rules. Traders said that on active trading days, the robot typed so fast that it sounded like a machine gun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peterffy became the father of digital trading. He would write code in his head during the trading day and then apply his ideas to computerized trading models after hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise of high-frequency trading in the stock market from January 2007 through January 2012.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="/the-supply-chain-race">&lt;p&gt;It’s not uncommon to hear people try to predict what the hot jobs of the future are going to be. Everything from machine learning to big data are put in this group, but one discipline that’s not mentioned is becoming increasingly important: supply chain engineering. It sounds boring, but it’s not. It’s the science of moving a thing from one place to another with the greatest speed and efficiency. Remember in the old cartoons when Wile E Coyote would put an order for a missile in the mailbox and a delivery truck would pull up and place the ordered item in the mailbox three seconds later? That’s the ultimate goal of this discipline. Let’s look at the big contenders in this race to own the supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon wants to so dominate the supply chain so that you don’t even have to leave your house for groceries. That’s part of the reason it purchased Kiva Systems for $775 million in 2012. Kiva’s robots bring shelves of goods out of storage and carry them to employees for sorting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog-3.gif&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also why Amazon announced the “Prime Air” drone delivery service. These moves are not random. They’re strategic. Amazon recently announced Dash buttons as well, which is an attempt to work the supply chain problem from the other direction. From the consumer back to the warehouse. You click a button, and the desired items show up on your doorstep. You didn’t even need to look at a computer screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog-img-4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google, unwilling to be outmaneuvered, has thrown its hat in the ring with the purchase of Boston Dynamics in December of 2013 for an undisclosed price. Until google purchased them, they did military contracts, but Google ended that with rumors that they would be leveraging the tech for supply chain management. This is very interesting because one of the weak links in automating warehouses is the ‘picker’. A picker’s role is to move certain specified items from one bin to another. The bins are brought to the picker via robots, but the picker must be able to recognize items and possess the dexterity to move objects of unpredictable sizes. The job of picker has not been automatable up to this point. My suspicion is that this is one of the nuts that google is trying to crack with their Boston Dynamic acquisition because human-like dexterity is exactly the kind of capability in which Boston Dynamics has excelled.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="/economy-2-0">&lt;p&gt;The future economy will barely be recognizable to human beings. Human minds will not play a signifiant roll in the economy that will be a characteristic of the technological singularity. This has already begun on the stock market in high frequency trading. The future is automation and intelligent systems. This is causing many people to freak out about the possibility of historically unprecedented unemployment. But machine automation is not the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Peter Thiel’s book &lt;a href=&quot;https://href.li/?http://zerotoonebook.com/&quot;&gt;Zero to One&lt;/a&gt;, he talks about the one two punch of human ingenuity and machine automation. He tells of how PayPal tried to completely automate their fraud detection but only discovered a successful approach when they adopted a combination strategy leveraging machine and human strengths. Human micro services are the other side of machine automation in the singularity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What cannot be automated will be farmed out in the form of micro services. One only has to look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uber.com%2F&amp;amp;t=N2ZjODkyNmE1MmQ2ODk4YzJiMzBiMzJkNjkzZDM5MWIyMTBiM2EzYyx3dmljakphNQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;b=t%3Amc9oE5TJkAXO_RNMdoK8vQ&amp;amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fsingularityhacker.com%2Fpost%2F107072514020%2Feconomy-2-0&amp;amp;m=1&amp;amp;ts=1642046840&quot;&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.wsj.com%2Fdigits%2F2014%2F08%2F11%2Ffiverr-raises-30m-for-services-marketplace%2F&amp;amp;t=MjQwMzZlYTRiNGI5MjYyZWM5YzE5ZDY5NzE5Njk0MDE0ODk3MmEyMyx3dmljakphNQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;b=t%3Amc9oE5TJkAXO_RNMdoK8vQ&amp;amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fsingularityhacker.com%2Fpost%2F107072514020%2Feconomy-2-0&amp;amp;m=1&amp;amp;ts=1642046840&quot;&gt;Fiverr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://href.li/?https://www.fancyhands.com&quot;&gt;FancyHands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://href.li/?http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/10/and-the-winner-of-techcrunch-disrupt-sf-2014-is-alfred/&quot;&gt;Alfred&lt;/a&gt; for evidences of the growing market for micro services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future economy will be dominated by procedurally generated digital goods and services, programmatically procured leads, and algorithmically optimized growth and experimentation strategies on the machine side and small relatively simple tasks for people on the human side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Charles Stross’s Accelerando “Economics 2.0 is a system that is ‘more efficient than any human-designed resource allocation schema’. It ‘replaces the single-indirection layer of conventional money, and the multiple-indirection mappings of options trades, with some kind of insanely baroque object-relational framework based on the parametrized desires and subjective experiential values of the players’. Human intelligence is incapable of participating in Economics 2.0 ‘without dehumanizing cognitive surgery’.https://href.li/?http://technoccult.net/archives/2011/06/18/william-gibson-on-the-creation-of-cyberspace/)&lt;/p&gt;</content>
